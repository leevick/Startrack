# STARTRACK - Target Detection & Trajectory Determination

## Objective

1. Detect and locate weak target in consecutive star images instantaneously 
2. Implement the algorithm based on DSP + FPGA hardware platfrom

## Steps
1. Methmatical modeling of the imaging, detecting & tracking system.
2. Algorithm designing, tweaking & optimizing in MATLAB
3. Determining hardware specifications.
4. Program designing, simulation verification & on-board verification.
5. Module unit testing & tweaking.
6. System testing & tweaking.


## Observarables
1. Detection Rate $P_d$, False Alarm Rate $P_f$
2. Precision of location measured in Mean Squre Error (MSE)
3. Data input rates of the system measured in MB/s
4. Time delay of the output data relative to the corresponding input data measured in ms
